    <h1>HISTORY OF MACHINE LANGUAGE</h1>
    <P>Machine Language In computer programming, machine code, consisting of machine language instructions, is a low-level programming
        language used to directly control a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to
        perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one
        or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory. Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended
        to run as fast as possible, and it may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled
        computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is possible to write programs
        directly in machine code, managing individual bits and calculating numerical addresses and constants manually is
        tedious and error-prone. For this reason, programs are very rarely written directly in machine code in modern contexts,
        but may be done for low level debugging, program patching (especially when assembler source is not available) and
        assembly language disassembly. The majority of practical programs today are written in higher-level languages or
        assembly language. The source code is then translated to executable machine code by utilities such as compilers,
        assemblers, and linkers, with the important exception of interpreted programs,[1] which are not translated into machine
        code. However, the interpreter itself, which may be seen as an executor or processor performing the instructions
        of the source code, typically consists of directly executable machine code (generated from assembly or high-level
        language source code). Machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail visible to the programmer,
        but internally many processors use microcode or optimise and transform machine code instructions into sequences of
        micro-ops. This is not generally considered to be a machine code.
